## Understanding Platform Users

<Card title="Platform User Overview" icon="users">
In the Affelios Ecosystem, a **Platform User** is an individual who has an Affelios Identity that has shared their information with your **Affiliate Platform** to become a collaborator and work with you to promote your Brands.
</Card>

### Default Platform Permissions

<Info>
By default, a new user that has registered with your platform will only have access to create affiliate accounts along with trackers and testimonials that are linked to those accounts.
</Info>

**Default User Capabilities:**
- Create unlimited affiliate accounts
- Create trackers and testimonials linked to their accounts
- View their own affiliate account data and reports
- Access basic program information

<Warning>
Default users cannot self-approve affiliate accounts or make changes that require elevated permissions. They must wait for operator approval for most actions.
