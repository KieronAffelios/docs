### Types of Commission Plans

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)">
    **Purpose:** Fixed commission fee paid once certain triggers are met
    
    **How it Works:**
    - Affiliate receives a fixed amount when specific actions occur
    - Examples: user registration, deposit, purchase completion
    - Can set up specific requirements like deposit amounts, net revenue, or wagering requirements
    - Multiple CPA levels possible for additional commissions after requirements are met
    
    **Best For:**
    - Clear, measurable conversion actions
    - Predictable commission costs
    - Performance-based compensation
    - New customer acquisition focus
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Revenue Share (RevShare)">

    - Commission calculated as a percentage of generated revenue
    - Can set up levels for higher commissions when targets are met
    - Example: 5% base rate, 10% on revenue exceeding £100
    
    **Best For:**
    - Long-term affiliate relationships
    - High-value customer acquisition
    - Ongoing revenue generation
    - Performance incentive alignment
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Hybrid">

## Commission Plan Hierarchy

<Card title="Plan Priority System" icon="sitemap">
Understanding how Affelios evaluates commission plans is crucial for effective plan management. The system uses a hierarchy based on specificity, applying the most specific match available for each transaction.
</Card>

### Plan Evaluation Order

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hierarchy Levels (Most to Least Specific)">
    **Commission Plan Evaluation Order:**  
    Affelios evaluates commission plans in order of specificity, using the most specific match available:

    1. **Affiliate + Brand + Product + Tracker** (Most specific)
    2. **Affiliate + Brand + Tracker**
    3. **Affiliate + Tracker**
    4. **Affiliate + Product**
    5. **Affiliate + Brand**
    6. **Affiliate only** (Least specific affiliate plan)
    7. **Default Product Plan** (Brand + Product)
    8. **Default Brand Plan**
    9. **Fully Default Plan** (System-wide fallback)

    **How It Works:**
    - System checks for the most specific plan first
    - Falls back to less specific plans if no match found
    - Always ensures a plan is applied (default as last resort)
    - More specific plans override less specific ones
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Practical Examples">
    **Scenario 1: High-Value Affiliate**
    ```
    Affiliate: "TopPerformer123"
    Brand: "PremiumBrand"
    Product: "LuxuryWidget"
    Tracker: "SummerCampaign"
    
    Evaluation Order:
    1. Check: Affiliate + Brand + Product + Tracker plan
    2. If not found: Check Affiliate + Brand + Tracker plan
    3. If not found: Check Affiliate + Tracker plan
    4. Continue down hierarchy...
    ```
    
    **Scenario 2: New Affiliate**
    ```
    Affiliate: "NewAffiliate456"
    Brand: "StandardBrand"
    Product: "BasicWidget"
    Tracker: "GeneralPromo"
    
    Evaluation Order:
    1. Check: Affiliate + Brand + Product + Tracker plan
    2. If not found: Check Affiliate + Brand + Tracker plan
    3. Continue until finding: Affiliate only plan
    4. Or fall back to: Default Product Plan
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Strategic Implementation">
    **Best Practices:**
    - Create specific plans for high-value affiliates
    - Set product-specific rates for different margin items
    - Use tracker-specific plans for performance incentives

    **Implementation Strategy:**
    - Start with default plans for all products/brands
    - Add affiliate-specific plans for top performers
    - Create tracker-specific plans for campaigns
    - Use product-specific plans for margin optimization
