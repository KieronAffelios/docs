## 4. Brands, Products & Media

<Card title="Brand & Product Management" icon="tag">
Once your program is configured, you'll need to create brands and products that affiliates can promote. This section covers setting up your catalog and tracking parameters.
</Card>

### 4.1 Create & Configure a Brand

Navigate to the **Brands** section to create your first brand. When adding a brand, you'll need to provide:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Information">
    - **Name**: Your brand's display name
    - **Industry**: The industry category your brand operates in
    - **External ID**: Your internal identifier for syncing with external systems
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Landing Page & Tracking">
    - **Landing Page URL**: Include the tracking parameter (ClickKey placeholder)
    
    <CodeGroup>
      <CodeGroupItem title="Example URLs" active>
        ```bash
        https://yourdomain.com/?clickId=[ClickKey]
        https://yourdomain.com/?referral=[ClickKey]
        https://yourdomain.com/product?utm_source=affiliate&clickId=[ClickKey]
        ```
      </CodeGroupItem>
    </CodeGroup>
    
    The parameter name must match how you set up tracking in your system.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Integration Options">
    Choose your preferred integration method:
    
    - REST API
    - JavaScript SDK
    - Webhook integration
    - Custom integration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 4.2 ClickKey & Tracking Parameter

<Info>
The **ClickKey** is the query parameter name you use to pass tracking IDs. This is how Affelios identifies which affiliate should receive credit for a conversion.
</Info>

<Card title="Common ClickKey Examples" icon="link">
<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="clickId" active>
    ```bash
    https://example.com/product?clickId=abc123
    ```
  </CodeGroupItem>
  <CodeGroupItem title="gclid">
    ```bash
    https://example.com/product?gclid=abc123
    ```
  </CodeGroupItem>
  <CodeGroupItem title="btag">
    ```bash
    https://example.com/product?btag=abc123
    ```
  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>
</Card>

When creating a brand, you specify the parameter placeholder (e.g. `[ClickKey]`) in your landing URL. Affelios will replace this with the actual tracking ID during use.  

### 4.3 Commission Plans & Selection Logic

<Card title="Commission Plan Hierarchy" icon="layers">
Affelios uses a sophisticated cascading system to determine which commission plan applies to each transaction, always choosing the most specific applicable plan.
</Card>

#### How Commission Plans Are Selected

<Info>
The system evaluates commission plans in order of specificity, starting with the most detailed combination and falling back to more general plans if no specific match is found.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Affiliate-Specific Plans (Highest Priority)">
    Affelios first looks for plans specific to the individual affiliate:
    
    1. **Affiliate + Brand + Product + Tracker** (Most specific)
    2. **Affiliate + Brand + Tracker**
    3. **Affiliate + Tracker**
    4. **Affiliate + Product**
    5. **Affiliate + Brand**
    6. **Affiliate only** (Least specific affiliate plan)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Default Plans (Fallback)">
    If no affiliate-specific plan matches, the system falls back to default plans:
    
    1. **Default Product Plan** (Brand + Product)
    2. **Default Brand Plan**
    3. **Fully Default Plan** (System-wide default)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
You can create commission rules at multiple scopes. The system always prefers the more specific plan over generic ones, giving you flexibility to create custom rates for specific affiliates or campaigns while maintaining sensible defaults.
</Tip>  

  
### 4.4 Uploading Media for Affiliates

<Card title="Marketing Assets" icon="image">
Providing high-quality marketing assets helps affiliates promote your brand more effectively and maintains brand consistency across all promotional materials.
</Card>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Media Section">
    Go to **Media → Upload Media** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Assets">
    Upload your marketing materials:
    - Images and banners
    - HTML5 ZIP packages following IAB guidelines
    - Logo variations
    - Product photos
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Landing Pages (Optional)">
    Assign custom landing pages per media asset so you can change redirect URLs without requiring affiliates to update their links.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish to Affiliate Portal">
    Affiliates will see these assets in their portal and can use them in their campaigns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Following IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) guidelines ensures your creative assets meet industry standards and work well across different advertising platforms.
</Tip>

### 4.5 Create & Configure Products

<Card title="Product Setup" icon="package">
Create products that affiliates can promote. Each product should be associated with a brand and can have its own commission rates and tracking settings.
</Card>

<Warning>
Product configuration details may vary based on your specific setup. The following represents the typical product creation flow.
</Warning>

When creating a product, you'll typically need to provide:

## 5. Tracking & Links

<Card title="Tracking & Link Management" icon="link-2">
Learn how to create and manage tracking links that allow affiliates to promote your products while ensuring proper attribution and commission tracking.
</Card>

### 5.1 How Tracking Works

<Info>
A **tracking link** is a URL that carries a unique identifier (via your ClickKey parameter) so that when users click and convert, the system knows which affiliate must be credited for the sale.
</Info>

<Card title="Tracking Flow" icon="arrow-right">
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Affiliate Link] --> B[User Clicks]
    B --> C[Tracking ID Captured]
    C --> D[User Converts]
    D --> E[Commission Credited]
```
</Card>

Affiliates can create multiple trackers to segment campaigns or traffic sources, giving you detailed insights into which promotional efforts are most effective.

### 5.2 Creating a Tracker & Traffic Source

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Trackers">
    Go to **Trackers** in the left navigation menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Traffic Source (Optional)">
    First, add or manage a **Traffic Source**:
    - Enter the source URL (e.g., affiliate's website, social channel)
    - Optionally verify via DNS record or meta tag for additional security
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Tracker">
    Create a **Tracker** with a descriptive label (e.g., "Email Campaign", "Social Media", "Website Banner").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Link">
    Once saved, use the "Get Link" action to copy a properly parameterized tracking link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reuse Tracker">
    You can reuse that tracker for future links to maintain consistent tracking across campaigns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 5.3 Generating Tracking Links

<Card title="Link Generation Process" icon="external-link">
Once your tracker exists, generating tracking links is straightforward.
</Card>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get Tracking Link">
    - Use the "Get Link" action next to your tracker to view the full URL
    - The link includes your ClickKey parameter with the actual tracking value
    - Copy and share with affiliates for embedding in promotions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Attribution Process">
    - Each time the link is clicked and a conversion occurs
    - Affelios attributes the conversion to the correct affiliate/tracker
    - Commission is calculated based on the plan hierarchy described in section 4.3
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>  

### 5.4 PPC / Google Tag Manager Integration (Parallel Tracking)

<Card title="Advanced Tracking Integration" icon="zap">
For PPC campaigns, parallel tracking ensures that clicks from paid advertising correctly pass through tracking parameters for proper attribution, even when users don't click through affiliate links.
</Card>

<Info>
Parallel tracking is essential for PPC campaigns because it allows you to attribute conversions to the correct affiliate even when users interact with your paid ads directly.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Parallel Tracking">
    In **Brands → Edit**, enable **parallel tracking** for the brand you want to track.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Code Snippet">
    Copy the provided JavaScript code snippet from the Affelios dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Google Tag Manager">
    In Google Tag Manager:
    - Create a **Custom HTML tag**
    - Paste the Affelios code snippet
    - Set trigger to **All Pages** (or your preferred trigger)
    - Save and publish the container
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Tracker Templates">
    Configure your tracker(s) to use the **parallel tracking** template:
    - By default, Affelios provides a Google template
    - You can also set custom templates if needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="Example GTM Configuration" active>
    ```html
    <!-- Affelios Parallel Tracking Code -->
    <script>
    // Your tracking code snippet from Affelios
    </script>
    ```
  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
With parallel tracking enabled, clicks from PPC campaigns will correctly pass through tracking parameters for attribution, ensuring affiliates receive proper credit for their promotional efforts.
