## Configuring Your Program

This is the foundational setup for your affiliate program. These settings will define how your program operates and how affiliates interact with your system.

<Card title="Program Configuration Overview" icon="gear">
The program configuration includes essential settings for branding, communication, payments, and tracking that will apply to your entire affiliate program.
</Card>

### Program Settings & Branding

Navigate to **Program / Settings** to configure your core program settings:

    Set up required legal documents and compliance settings:

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>  

### Affiliate Payout Options

<Card title="Payment Configuration" icon="credit-card">
Configure the payment processors you support so that affiliates can choose one that's suitable for them.
</Card>

Still within program settings, select which payment processors you support:

- Bank transfer
- PayPal
- Cryptocurrency
- Other payment processors

<Info>
By enabling these payment processors, you're giving affiliates the flexibility to choose the payment method that works best for their location, preferences, and business needs.
</Info>

Affiliates will be able to select from these supported payment processors when registering and setting up their payout preferences.

<Tip>
Also configure any relevant tax settings (e.g. withholding, VAT, etc.) based on your business location and legal requirements.
</Tip>

### Custom Domain Setup (Optional but Recommended)

<Warning>
While optional, using a custom domain significantly improves your program's professional appearance and brand consistency.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Recommended for Ad Performance:** Configuring a custom domain is highly recommended as it can help avoid issues around URL blacklisting and ad blockers. Using your own branded domain instead of the default Affelios domain reduces the risk of your affiliate links being blocked by ad blockers or flagged by security filters.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Custom Domain">
    Click **Add Custom Domain** in your program settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Hostname">
    Enter the hostname you wish to use (e.g., `affiliates.yourcompany.com`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure DNS Records">
    Add the required DNS records to your domain registrar as provided by Affelios.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate Configuration">
    After DNS propagation (which may take time), validate the records via the "Validate" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Mark the domain-setup step as complete once validation is successful.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
DNS propagation can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours depending on your domain provider and geographic location.
</Info>

## Brands, Products & Media

<Card title="Brand & Product Management" icon="tag">
Once your program is configured, you'll need to create brands and products that affiliates can promote. This section covers setting up your catalog and tracking parameters.
</Card>

### Create & Configure a Brand

Navigate to the **Brands** section to create your first brand. When adding a brand, you'll need to provide:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Information">
    - **Name**: Your brand's display name
    - **Industry**: The industry category your brand operates in
    - **External ID**: Your internal identifier for syncing with external systems
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Landing Page & Tracking">
    - **Landing Page URL**: Include the tracking parameter (ClickKey placeholder)
    
    <CodeGroup>
        ```bash
        https://yourdomain.com/?clickId=[ClickKey]
        https://yourdomain.com/?referral=[ClickKey]
        https://yourdomain.com/product?utm_source=affiliate&clickId=[ClickKey]
        ```
    </CodeGroup>
    
    The parameter name must match how you set up tracking in your system.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Integration Options">
    Choose your preferred integration method:
    
    - REST API
    - JavaScript SDK
    - Webhook integration
    - Custom integration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### ClickKey & Tracking Parameter

<Info>
The **ClickKey** is a unique tracking value provided by Affelios that enables the tracking of a customer's journey from click to conversion. This value is passed back to Affelios when the customer transacts, allowing the system to properly attribute the sale to the correct affiliate.
</Info>

#### How ClickKey Tracking Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link Generation">
    When an affiliate creates a tracking link, Affelios generates a unique ClickKey value for that specific link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Click">
    When a customer clicks the affiliate link, they're redirected to your site with the ClickKey parameter included in the URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Session Tracking">
    Your website captures and stores the ClickKey value (typically in cookies or session storage) to maintain attribution throughout the customer's visit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conversion Event">
    When the customer completes a purchase, your system sends the ClickKey value back to Affelios along with the transaction details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commission Attribution">
    Affelios uses the ClickKey to identify which affiliate should receive credit for the sale and processes the commission accordingly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Example Landing Page URLs and ClickKey Parameter Names

<Card icon="link">
<CodeGroup>
    ```bash clickId
    https://example.com/product?clickId=abc123
    ```

    ```bash gclid
    https://example.com/product?gclid=abc123
    ```

    ```bash btag
    https://example.com/product?btag=abc123
    ```
</CodeGroup>
</Card>

<Info>
When creating a brand, you specify the parameter placeholder (e.g. `[ClickKey]`) in your landing URL. Affelios will replace this with the actual tracking ID during use, and this same value will be used to track the customer's journey and attribute commissions.
</Info>  

### Commission Plans & Selection Logic

<Card title="Commission Plan Hierarchy" icon="layer-group">
Affelios uses a sophisticated cascading system to determine which commission plan applies to each transaction, always choosing the most specific applicable plan.
</Card>

#### How Commission Plans Are Selected

<Info>
The system evaluates commission plans in order of specificity, starting with the most detailed combination and falling back to more general plans if no specific match is found.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Affiliate-Specific Plans (Highest Priority)">
    Affelios first looks for plans specific to the individual affiliate:
    
    1. **Affiliate + Brand + Product + Tracker** (Most specific)
    2. **Affiliate + Brand + Tracker**
    3. **Affiliate + Tracker**
    4. **Affiliate + Product**
    5. **Affiliate + Brand**
    6. **Affiliate only** (Least specific affiliate plan)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Default Plans (Fallback)">
    If no affiliate-specific plan matches, the system falls back to default plans:
    
    1. **Default Product Plan** (Brand + Product)
    2. **Default Brand Plan**
    3. **Fully Default Plan** (System-wide default)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
You can create commission rules at multiple scopes. The system always prefers the more specific plan over generic ones, giving you flexibility to create custom rates for specific affiliates or campaigns while maintaining sensible defaults.
</Tip>  

  
### Uploading Media for Affiliates

<Card title="Marketing Assets" icon="image">
Providing high-quality marketing assets helps affiliates promote your brand more effectively and maintains brand consistency across all promotional materials.
</Card>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Media Section">
    Go to **Media → Upload Media** in your dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Assets">
    Upload your marketing materials:
    - Images and banners
    - HTML5 ZIP packages following IAB guidelines
    - Logo variations
    - Product photos
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Landing Pages (Optional)">
    Assign custom landing pages per media asset so you can change redirect URLs without requiring affiliates to update their links.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish to Affiliate Portal">
    Affiliates will see these assets in their portal and can use them in their campaigns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Following [IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau)](https://www.iab.com/) guidelines ensures your creative assets meet industry standards and work well across different advertising platforms.
</Tip>

### Create & Configure Products

<Card title="Product Setup" icon="box-taped">
Create products that affiliates can promote. Each product should be associated with a brand and can have its own commission rates and tracking settings.
</Card>

<Warning>
Product configuration details may vary based on your specific setup. The following represents the typical product creation flow.
</Warning>
