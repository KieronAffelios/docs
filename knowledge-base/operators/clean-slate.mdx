title: "Clean Slate (No-Negative Carryover)"
description: "Configure clean slate policy to prevent negative balance carryover between payment periods - ensuring affiliates start each cycle with a fresh balance"
---

<Info>
This guide is specifically for **program operators** who want to configure clean slate (no-negative carryover) policies for their affiliate programs. This is a program-wide setting that affects how negative balances are handled between payment cycles.
</Info>

## Clean Slate Overview

<Card title="No-Negative Carryover Policy" icon="arrows-rotate">
Clean slate is a program-wide setting that prevents negative affiliate balances from carrying over to the next payment period. When enabled, affiliates start each new payment cycle with a zero balance, regardless of any negative balance from the previous period.
</Card>

### How Clean Slate Works in Affelios

<Steps>
  <Step title="Payment Period Ends">
    At the end of each payment period, the system calculates final balances for all affiliates, including any negative amounts from refunds, chargebacks, or commission adjustments.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clean Slate Application">
    If clean slate is enabled, any affiliate with a negative balance has their balance reset to zero instead of carrying the negative amount forward.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fresh Start">
    All affiliates begin the new payment period with either their positive balance (if any) or zero balance, ensuring no one starts in debt.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Standard Processing (if disabled)">
    If clean slate is disabled, negative balances carry forward and must be recovered from future commissions before new payouts can occur.
  </Step>
</Steps>
