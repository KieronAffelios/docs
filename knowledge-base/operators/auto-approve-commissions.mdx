<Info>
This guide is specifically for **program operators** who want to streamline commission processing by automatically approving affiliate commissions. If you're an affiliate looking to understand commission processing, see [Affiliate Lifecycle](/knowledge-base/operations/affiliate-lifecycle).
</Info>

## Auto-Approve Overview

<Card title="Automated Commission Processing" icon="circle-check">
Auto-approve commissions is a simple per-brand setting that eliminates the need to manually approve each commission. When enabled, all commissions for transactions sent to Affelios are automatically approved and queued for payment, removing the administrative overhead of reviewing each commission individually.
</Card>

### How Auto-Approve Works in Affelios

<Steps>
  <Step title="Transaction Processing">
    When a customer completes a purchase through an affiliate link, you send the transaction data to Affelios where commissions are calculated based on your commission plans.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Commission Creation">
    Affelios processes the transaction and creates commissions for the relevant affiliates based on attribution and commission plan rules.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Approval">
    If auto-approve is enabled for the brand, commissions are immediately approved and queued for the next payment cycle without requiring manual review.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manual Review (if disabled)">
    If auto-approve is disabled, commissions remain pending until you manually review and approve each one through the Affelios dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Advisory: Auto-Approve Affiliates

<Card title="Critical Security Consideration" icon="shield-exclamation">
<Info>
**Important**: Affelios also offers [Auto-Approve Affiliates](/knowledge-base/operators/auto-approve-affiliates) functionality. Using both auto-approve features together significantly increases fraud risk.
</Info>

**Recommended Approach:**
- **If enabling auto-approve commissions**: Keep affiliate approval manual for better security
- **If using auto-approve affiliates**: Keep commission approval manual to maintain oversight
- **Avoid using both together** unless you have robust fraud detection and monitoring systems

**Why This Matters:**
When both features are enabled, fraudulent affiliates can be automatically approved and their fraudulent commissions can be automatically paid out, creating a high-risk scenario with minimal human oversight until the payout phase.
