Automated deductions is a per-brand setting that allows you to automatically exclude specific business costs from commission calculations. This ensures affiliates are only paid commissions on net revenue after accounting for taxes, deposits, processing fees, and other operational costs.

### How Automated Deductions Work in Affelios

  <Step title="Deduction Application">
    Affelios automatically applies the configured deductions (tax, deposits, fees) to calculate the net revenue amount for commission purposes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Commission Calculation">
    Commissions are calculated based on the net revenue amount after deductions, ensuring affiliates are paid on actual profit rather than gross sales.
