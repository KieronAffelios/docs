<Info>
This guide explains how to add collaborators to your affiliate accounts and manage their access levels. As an **affiliate**, you can invite team members to help manage your affiliate accounts while maintaining control over permissions.
</Info>

## Understanding Affiliate Account Access

<Card title="Collaborator Overview" icon="user-group">
Beyond platform permissions, users can also have specific roles and permissions within individual affiliate accounts. This allows you to share access to your affiliate accounts with team members while maintaining appropriate security controls.
</Card>

### Company Ownership and Payout Permissions

<Info>
When you create a new affiliate account inside an affiliate platform, you are required to associate a Company Account from the Affelios Company service which is attached as the beneficial owner of the account and any commissions that are generated by it.
</Info>

**Company Ownership Rules:**
- Only people who have access to the Affiliate Account **AND** the Company associated are able to transfer ownership of the affiliate account
- Only company owners can set new Payout information on the account where commissions are paid out to
- Company ownership is separate from platform permissions

<Warning>
Company ownership is a critical security feature. Only grant company access to trusted team members who need to manage payout information and account ownership.
</Warning>
