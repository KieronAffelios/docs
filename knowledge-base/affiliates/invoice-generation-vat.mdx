<Info>
This guide explains how invoice generation works in Affelios and how to properly configure your tax settings to ensure accurate VAT calculations on your affiliate commission invoices.
</Info>

## Understanding Invoice Generation

<Card title="The Invoice Generation Process" icon="file-invoice">
In Affelios, invoices are automatically generated during payout periods by program administrators. These invoices document your earned commissions and any applicable taxes, providing the official record needed for payment processing and tax compliance.
</Card>

### How Invoice Generation Works

<Info>
Invoices are created during the payout process and are run by program administrators according to their payment schedules. Once generated, you can access all your invoices through the "Payouts" section in your affiliate dashboard.
</Info>

**Key Invoice Generation Concepts:**
- **Automated Process:** Invoices are generated automatically during payout runs
- **Program-Controlled:** Program administrators control when payouts and invoices are processed
- **Threshold Requirements:** Some programs require minimum commission thresholds before generating payouts
- **Tax Integration:** VAT and tax calculations are included when properly configured

### The Invoice Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Commission Accumulation">
    Your affiliate commissions accumulate throughout the tracking period based on successful sales and conversions from your promotional activities.

    Program administrators run payout processes according to their schedule (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.) based on program terms.
  </Step>

## Understanding VAT and Tax Calculations

<Card title="Tax Compliance for Affiliate Commissions" icon="calculator">
VAT (Value Added Tax) and other tax calculations are automatically computed during invoice generation when you have properly configured your tax settings. Understanding these calculations helps ensure compliance and accurate financial record-keeping.
</Card>

### How VAT Calculation Works

<Info>
VAT is calculated during the payout process based on your configured tax settings. If your tax settings are not properly set up in your affiliate payout settings, tax calculations will not appear on your invoices, potentially causing compliance issues.
</Info>

**VAT Calculation Process:**
1. **Tax Settings Check:** System verifies your Tax ID and percentage settings
2. **Jurisdiction Determination:** Identifies applicable tax rates based on your location and program
3. **Commission Base:** Calculates VAT on your gross commission amount
4. **Net Calculation:** Determines your net payment after tax deductions
5. **Invoice Documentation:** Records all tax calculations on your invoice

### Tax Setting Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Required Tax Information">
    **Essential Tax Details:**
    - **Tax ID Number:** Your official tax identification number (VAT number, SSN, EIN, etc.)
    - **Tax Percentage:** The applicable tax rate for your jurisdiction and situation
    - **Business Classification:** Whether you're operating as an individual or business entity
    - **Geographic Location:** Your tax residence for compliance purposes
    
    **Important Notes:**
    - Tax calculations will NOT appear on invoices without specified Tax IDs
    - Previous invoices cannot be regenerated with updated tax calculations
    - Only future invoices will include tax calculations after setup
    - Consult tax professionals for complex situations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="International Tax Considerations">
    **Cross-Border Tax Issues:**
    - **Double Taxation:** Understanding treaties between countries
    - **Withholding Taxes:** Taxes deducted at source by foreign programs
    - **Local Reporting:** Your responsibility to report income in your tax jurisdiction
    - **Currency Conversion:** Tax calculations on foreign currency earnings
    
    **Common International Scenarios:**
    - EU affiliates promoting US programs (FATCA compliance)
    - US affiliates promoting international programs
    - Non-EU affiliates working with EU programs (VAT obligations)
    - Digital services tax implications for online affiliate income
