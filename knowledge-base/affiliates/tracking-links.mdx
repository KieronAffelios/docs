## Understanding the Tracker Foundation

In Affelios, tracking begins with **trackers** - these are the building blocks that represent your promotional campaigns or traffic sources. Understanding trackers is essential because they form the foundation for all your tracking links.

### What Are Trackers?

Trackers are campaign identifiers that help you organize and measure your promotional efforts. Each tracker represents a specific traffic source, promotional strategy, or marketing channel.

## From Trackers to Tracking Links

<Card title="The Link Generation Process" icon="link">
Now that you understand trackers, learn how to transform them into working tracking links that drive commissions. This is where your tracker strategy becomes actionable promotional content.
</Card>

### The Tracker-Link Relationship

<Info>
In Affelios, you don't create tracking links directly. Instead, you generate tracking links by combining your trackers with specific brands or products. This approach ensures consistent campaign tracking and better performance analytics.
</Info>

**How It Works:**
1. **Tracker (What):** Represents your promotional campaign or traffic source
2. **Brand (Where):** Specifies which brand/merchant you're promoting
3. **Product (Optional):** Targets specific products within the brand
4. **Link (Result):** The final tracking URL that customers click

### Generating Your Tracking Links

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Tracker">
    Choose the tracker that represents your current promotional campaign. This could be `youtube-reviews` for a video campaign or `homepage-banner` for website promotion.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Your Brand">
    Select the brand you want to promote. This determines which merchant's products you'll be promoting through this specific tracker.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Products (Optional)">
    Optionally choose specific products to promote. Leave blank for general brand promotion where customers can browse all products.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate and Test">
    The system generates your unique tracking link. Always test the link to ensure proper functionality before deploying in your campaigns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding Link Structure

## How the Tracking Process Works

<Card title="From Click to Commission" icon="arrow-right">
Now that you understand trackers and tracking links, let's explore what happens when customers click your links and how you get credited for sales.
</Card>

### The Complete Tracking Flow

Here's exactly how the tracking process works in Affelios:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tracker-Based Link Generation">
    You use your created tracker to generate a unique tracking link for a specific brand or product. This link contains your affiliate ID, tracker ID, and targeting information.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customer Click & ClickKey Creation">
    When a potential customer clicks your tracking link, Affelios automatically generates a **ClickKey** that is unique to that customer and tied to your tracker. This ClickKey is what attributes the customer back to you.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="ClickKey Storage & Customer Journey">
    The ClickKey is stored (typically as a cookie) and follows the customer through their browsing and purchasing journey on the operator's website.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Purchase Attribution & Commission">
    When the customer makes a purchase, the ClickKey links the sale back to your specific tracker, and Affelios calculates your commission based on the applicable commission plan.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Makes Tracking Successful

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Technical Requirements">
    **For Proper Attribution:**
    - Customer's browser must accept cookies (or alternative tracking methods)
    - ClickKey must be properly stored by the merchant's website
    - Customer must complete purchase within the attribution window
    - Merchant's system must properly report sales to Affelios
    
    **Common Technical Challenges:**
    - Cookie blocking or privacy settings
    - Cross-device purchases (click on mobile, buy on desktop)
    - Browser privacy features affecting tracking
    - Ad blockers interfering with tracking scripts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Attribution Windows and Rules">
    **Timing Factors:**
    - **Attribution Window:** How long after clicking your link you can get credit (typically 30-90 days)
    - **Same-Session Sales:** You always get credit if they buy during the same visit
    - **Return Customers:** You may get credit when they return to buy later
    - **Repeat Purchases:** Some programs give lifetime credit for customers
    
    **Attribution Logic:**
    - **First-Click:** You get credit even if they click other affiliate links later
    - **Last-Click:** The most recent affiliate link gets the credit
    - **Program-Specific:** Each program may have its own attribution rules
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Commission Attribution Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Your Commission Rate Is Determined">
    **Commission Plan Priority System:**
    Affelios uses a priority system to determine your commission rate for each sale. More specific plans take priority over general ones:
    
    **Your Specific Rates (Highest Priority):**
    - Special rates for specific products you promote
    - Rates for specific trackers or campaigns you run
    - Custom rates negotiated just for you
    - Your general affiliate rate
    
    **Program Defaults (Fallback):**
    - Standard product rates
    - General program rates
    - Platform-wide default rates
    
    **What This Means for You:**
    - Different trackers may have different commission rates
    - Product-specific promotions might earn bonus rates
    - High-performing trackers often get better rates over time
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multiple Tracker Scenarios">
    **When Customers Click Multiple Links:**
    If a customer clicks multiple of your tracker links, the program's attribution rules determine which gets credit:
    - Some programs give credit to all trackers (split attribution)
    - Others use first-click or last-click rules
    - Different trackers you create may compete for the same sale
    
    **Common Multi-Tracker Scenarios:**
    - Customer clicks your `youtube-review` link, then your `homepage-banner` link
    - Customer shares your `social-media` link and someone else clicks it
    - Customer clicks your `mobile-app` tracker, then buys via your `email-newsletter` tracker
    
    **Best Practice:** Check your program's specific attribution rules to understand how multiple tracker interactions are handled.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### From Click to Commission: The Complete Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Clicks Your Tracker Link">
    When someone clicks your tracking link, they're associated with your specific tracker, allowing you to see which campaigns drive results.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Attribution Processing">
    When they make a purchase, the system determines:
    - That you should get credit for the sale
    - Which specific tracker generated the sale
    - What commission rate applies to that tracker
    - The final commission amount you'll earn
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Commission Appears in Dashboard">
    Your commission is recorded and appears in your affiliate dashboard:
    - Shows the sale amount and your commission
    - **Indicates which tracker generated the sale** (key for campaign optimization)
    - Updates your performance metrics by tracker
    - Adds to your pending payments
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Payment Processing">
    According to the program's payment schedule, your commission is processed and paid according to your payment preferences.
  </Step>
</Steps>
