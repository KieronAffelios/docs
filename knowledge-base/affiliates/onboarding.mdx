## Creating Your Affelios Identity

<Card title="Affelios Identity" icon="user-plus">
Your **Affelios Identity** is your universal account that allows you to join and manage multiple affiliate programs across the Affelios platform. Once you create your Identity, you can easily apply to different programs without needing to create separate accounts for each one.
</Card>

<Info>
**One Account, Multiple Programs:** With a single Affelios Identity, you can join multiple affiliate programs, manage all your partnerships from one dashboard, and maintain a consistent profile across all programs you participate in.
</Info>

<Info>
**Multiple Affiliates:** As a user, you can also create multiple affiliate accounts under your single Affelios Identity. This allows you to manage different affiliate personas or business entities while keeping everything organized under one login.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find an Affiliate Program">
    Browse available affiliate programs or use the direct invitation link provided by the program operator.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Affelios Identity">
    Create a new **Affelios Identity** account if you don't already have one. This single account will serve as your gateway to all Affelios affiliate programs.
  </Step>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Approval Process">
    Depending on the program's requirements, you may need to wait for approval or be granted immediate access. Some programs offer **auto-approval**, meaning you'll be accepted immediately upon application. Others require manual review to ensure quality and alignment with their brand standards, or may even require you to contact the program's administrators directly for approval. This process can take anywhere from immediate access to several days.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Account Activation">
    Once approved, you'll receive a confirmation email and gain access to your affiliate portal for that specific program.

  <Step title="Choose a Brand">
    Select the brand you want to promote from the available brands in your affiliate program.
