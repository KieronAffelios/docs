Learn how to transition away from your current sign‑in provider for Affelios Identity. Today, changing or adding a new provider to an existing account is not supported. To switch providers, you must create a new account and replicate your previous permissions and access.

## For affiliates

Affiliates cannot self‑migrate permissions across programs. For each program you promote, contact the program manager and request that your permissions be re‑assigned from your old account to your new one.

<Info>
  This guidance assumes you operate as a brand creating a new admin account for your program. If you are an affiliate, you must contact the program manager for each program you promote and have them re‑assign your permissions from your old account to your new account.

## Why create a new account?

Affelios Identity currently does not support changing or adding sign‑in providers on an existing account. To transition, create a new account and manually replicate roles, privileges, and access to programs and resources so your new account has the same capabilities as your previous one.

## Steps to transition

1. **Create a new account**
   - Visit the registration page and create a new account.
   - If you need a walkthrough, see [Create an Identity](/knowledge-base/identity/create-identity).

2. **Replicate permissions**
   - Assign the same roles and privileges to your new account that your previous account had.
   - Ensure access to the same programs, resources, and environments.

3. **Test the new setup**
   - Sign in with the new account and verify you can access everything required.
   - Confirm all permissions behave as expected.

## Tips and considerations

- Keep your old account active until you confirm the new account works as expected.
- Document the roles and program access tied to the old account to streamline replication.
- Enable two‑factor authentication (2FA) on the new account where available.
