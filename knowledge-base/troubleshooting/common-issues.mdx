    **Symptoms:**
    - "Account disabled" message when logging into a program
    - Unable to access specific program features
    - Program access denied notification
    
    **Causes:**
    - Program-specific account suspension by affiliate manager
    - Policy violations within that specific program
    - Manual account disabling by program operator
    - Program-specific compliance issues
    
    **Important Distinction:**
    - Account disabled is **program-specific**, not platform-wide
    - You can still access other programs where your account is enabled
    - This is different from a platform-wide account lock
    
    **Solutions:**
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Verify Program Access">
        Check if you can access other programs to confirm this is program-specific.

      </Step>

    Account disabled messages are program-specific. Your Affelios Identity remains active and you can continue using other programs where your account is enabled.
    </Info>
    
    <Warning>
    Program-specific account disabling is typically permanent unless resolved with the program manager. Focus on understanding the specific reason and working toward resolution.

## Tracking and Attribution Issues

Tracking and attribution issues can significantly impact your affiliate program's performance. These problems typically involve missing clicks, failed conversions, or incorrect attribution that affects commission calculations.
</Card>

### Missing Clicks

<AccordionGroup>

    **Solutions:**
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check Account Status">
        Verify your account is approved in the program. If you see "account disabled," you may be awaiting approval.
      </Step>

        Click your own tracking links to verify they redirect properly and generate clicks.
      </Step>
