## Relationships & Flows

Here‚Äôs how the pieces fit together in practice:

1. An **operator** creates a **program**, configures its branding, commission plans, traffic sources, etc.  
2. An **affiliate** uses their **Affelios Identity** to join the program.  
3. The affiliate sets up **trackers** and promotes via verified **traffic sources**.  
4. When conversions happen, they are tracked via the tracker, attributed to the affiliate.  
5. Earnings accumulate; at payout time the affiliate is paid via their chosen **payout method**. An invoice is generated, VAT/tax handled.  
6. If ‚ÄúClean Slate / No-Negative Carryover‚Äù is enabled, balances reset (negatives cleared) each period.

## Getting Started Tips

- When you first set up a program, decide up front on a **clickKey** that works for all your affiliates.  
- Require traffic source verification if you want to maintain data quality and reduce fraud.  
- Set up at least two payout methods for affiliates in case one fails or isn't supported. 
- Think about whether ‚ÄúClean Slate‚Äù policy suits your business model (some programs prefer to let negative balances carry over).
