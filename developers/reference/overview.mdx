Welcome to the Affelios Developer Reference. This section provides comprehensive technical documentation for integrating with the Affelios affiliate marketing platform.

## Getting Started

The Affelios platform offers multiple integration methods to suit different technical requirements and use cases:

### Integration Options

1. **API Integration**
   - RESTful API for programmatic access
   - Real-time data synchronization
   - Custom application development
   - Advanced automation capabilities

2. **Webhook Integration**
   - Real-time event notifications
   - Automated workflow triggers
   - System-to-system communication
   - Event-driven architecture

3. **SDK Integration**
   - Pre-built libraries for popular languages
   - Simplified development process
   - Consistent implementation patterns
   - Reduced development time

## API Overview

### Base URL
```
https://platform.affelios.com/api/v1
```

### Authentication
All API requests require authentication using API keys or OAuth 2.0 tokens. See our [Authentication Guide](./authentication) for detailed implementation instructions.

### Rate Limiting
- Standard: 1000 requests per hour
- Burst: 100 requests per minute
- Enterprise plans include higher limits

### Response Format
All API responses use JSON format with consistent structure:

```json
{
  "data": { /* response data */ },
  "meta": { /* pagination, timestamps */ },
  "errors": [ /* error details if applicable */ ]
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Affiliate Programs
Programs created by operators to manage affiliate relationships, commissions, and tracking.

### Tracking Links
Unique URLs that enable attribution of traffic and conversions to specific affiliates.

### Conversions
Actions taken by users (purchases, signups, etc.) that result in affiliate commissions.

### Webhooks
HTTP callbacks that notify your system of events in real-time.

## Quick Start Examples

### JavaScript/Node.js
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://platform.affelios.com/api/v1/account', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const data = await response.json();
```

### Python
```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://platform.affelios.com/api/v1/account',
    headers=headers
)
data = response.json()
```

### PHP
```php
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://platform.affelios.com/api/v1/account');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type: application/json'
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
$data = json_decode($response, true);
curl_close($ch);
```
