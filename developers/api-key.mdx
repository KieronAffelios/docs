---

<Info>
API Keys enable comprehensive programmatic access to the Affelios platform, allowing you to retrieve data, manage integrations, synchronize information, and interact with all platform features without manual dashboard access. This guide will show you how to create API keys and help you understand how API keys are scoped so that you know how to best manage API access for your programs and integrations.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before creating API keys, ensure you have the necessary permissions:

<Card title="Required Permissions" icon="shield-check">
- **API Keys Permission**: Minimum requirement for creating and managing API keys
- **User Access**: Affiliates need to request this permission from their program manager
- **Operator Access**: Operators can grant API key permissions to users
</Card>

<Warning>
**Security Notice**: Program managers should avoid creating API keys for users. Instead, grant them access to create their own API keys. This ensures that API keys are automatically limited to the data the user already has permission to access. If a user has admin access, they'll be allowed to view all data within a program through their API keys, but if they're an affiliate, they'll only see their own data regardless of API key permissions.
</Warning>

## Creating API Keys

### Step-by-Step Creation Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access API Key Settings">
    Navigate to your **Settings** and select **"API Keys"** from the menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New API Key">
    Click the **"Create API Key"** button to start the creation process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    Assign different permissions to your API key depending on your use case. You can only assign permissions within the scope of permissions your user possesses on the related program.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy and Store Key">
    Once created, copy and securely store your API key. You will not be able to retrieve this key again at a later time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Permission Configuration

<Card title="Permission Best Practices" icon="gear">
When configuring API key permissions, follow these guidelines:
- Avoid assigning all read/write permissions
- Keep API key permissions limited to their required purpose
- Only assign permissions that match your user's access level
- Regularly review and update permissions as needed
</Card>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Available Permissions">
    API keys can be configured with various permission levels:
    
    - **Read Access**: View data and reports
    - **Write Access**: Create and modify data
    - **Admin Access**: Full program management capabilities
    - **Affiliate Access**: Limited to own affiliate data
    - **Operator Access**: Full program access (if user has operator role)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission Scoping">
    **User Permission Constraints:**
    API keys are **always limited by the user's existing permissions**. You can only assign API key permissions that match or are within the scope of permissions your user account already possesses on the related program.
    
    **Data Access Levels:**
    - **Affiliate Level**: Access only to own affiliate data (affiliates can only see their own data)
    - **Program Level**: Access to all data within a program (operators can see all program data)
    
    **Functional Permissions:**
    - **API Keys**: Create and manage API keys (requires API Keys permission)
    - **Reports**: Generate and export reports (requires Reports permission)
    - **Affiliates**: Manage affiliate accounts (requires Affiliate Management permission)
    - **Commissions**: View and manage commission data (requires Commission access)
    
    <Warning>
    **Important**: If you are an affiliate, you will only be able to view or modify your own data through API keys, even if you have API key permissions. Program managers should grant users the ability to create their own API keys rather than creating keys for them.
    </Warning>

## API Key Structure

<Card title="Key Format" icon="key">
API keys follow a specific format for identification and security:
</Card>

```
5XPmdXTl8j93xI0j45b6a3fd-1062-4c11-b434-b8de3e4eafeb
│
└── Unique identifier with random characters and UUID format
```

<Info>
API keys are scoped to an individual user and can only access data that the user has permission to view. The data scope is **always limited by the user's existing permissions** - API keys cannot provide access to data beyond what the user account can already see through the dashboard. The key format includes both random characters and UUID components for enhanced security.
</Info>

## Using API Keys

### Authentication Method

<Card title="Authentication in Requests" icon="lock">
To use your API key in requests, include it in the `X-Api-Key` header of all API calls. For detailed examples and implementation guidance, see our [Authentication documentation](/developers/authentication).
